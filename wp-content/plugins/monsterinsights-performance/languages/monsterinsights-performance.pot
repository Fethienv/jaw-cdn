msgid "Specifies what percentage of users should be tracked. This defaults to 100 when field is blank (no users are sampled out) but large sites may need to use a lower sample rate to stay within Google Analytics processing limits. Note, setting this setting to a number lower than 100 means not all of your users will be tracked into Google Analytics."
